This API is built using three interconnected models: movies, reviews, and stream platforms. The relationships between these models are as follows:

One movie can have multiple reviews.
One platform can have multiple movies.
However, a movie can only sell rights to a specific platform.
Functionalities provided by this API:

User Actions:

Users can view the reviews of any movie to make an informed decision about whether to watch it or not.
Owner/Admin Actions:

Happy Coding!
